  <p>Welcome to the Frog on a Dog Blog! The purpose of this blog is to showcase the life and times of my two favorite animals: Harry, and Sally.</p>

  <!--My Pets-->
  <h3>Harry (Frog)</h3>
  <p>Harry was my first pet. A member of the bufo fowleri tribe, he's definitely a midwest kind of frog. He loves the sun and hates the cold, votes blue come election time, and can't stand seeing the Bears lose. (Often he will throw things at the TV when a there's a sudden turnover.)</p>

  <h3>Sally (Dog)</h3>
  <p>Sally is Harry's girl. She goes everywhere with him and he goes everywhere with her. Harry may be MY pet but Sally is Harry's pet. She only listens to Harry and does whatever he says.</p>

  <!--Favorite Toys-->
  <h2>Favorite Toys</h2>
  <p>Harry's favorite toy is a BB gun that I got him for Christmas. Sometimes Harry likes to play pranks with his BB gun. Often I will wake up in the morning to find Harry standing over me menacingly, BB gun in hand, pointed right at my head. Once I'm awake he hides the gun behind his back and smiles so I know he's just kidding around.</p>

  <p>Sally's favorite toy is the rare, 1983 Cabbage Patch kid that Harry got her for their first aniversary. Other than Harry, it's the thing that Sally loves most in this world.</p>


  <!--Favorite Activities-->
  <h2>Favorite Activities</h2>
  <p>Harry loves to go on long walks with Sally. He prefers the scenic root over any shortcuts, being more of an outdoor frog.</p>

  <p>Sally's favorite past time is watching reruns of Maury. Everytime they confirm who the father is she leaps off the couch and jumps up and down along with the women on the show.</p>
